## Description

_{This webpage is a basic typing game with increasing difficulty. When the user clicks the "play" button, the game will begin. The cursor will appear in the text box (input field), the timer will start, the music will start, and the background animation will start. The music and background animation are both tied to the timer so that the music will increase in speed and the background will change every five seconds. The timer will reset as the player advances levels, which will reset the background animation, time, music and speed as well. The levels are defined by the number of syllables in the words. Each level randomly selects 5 words for an array of 30 words. Level 1 has one syllable words, level 2 has two syllables, three syllables in level 3, and so on. Once the player beats level 7, the game enters the final round. The final round sets the timer to 10 seconds per word and will have the player go through all 30 7-syllable words in the 7th level array. The game will end with a "game over" screen if the play runs out of time at any point. If the player can make it all the way through the final round, the game will end with a "victory" screen. Their score will be displayed as they progress through the game and will display their final score when the game ends. The game will refresh the page when the player either clicks the "play again" or "start over" button, clearing the score.}_
